## About Citi Bike
Citi Bike is New York City’s bike share system, and the largest in the nation. Citi Bike launched in May 2013 and has become an essential part of our transportation network. It's fun, efficient and affordable – not to mention healthy and good for the environment.<br/>
<img align="right" width="250" src="/pics/bike3.png"><br/> 
Citi Bike, like other bike share systems, consists of a fleet of specially designed, sturdy and durable bikes that are locked into a network of docking stations throughout the city. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system, making them ideal for one-way trips. People use bike share to commute to work or school, run errands, get to appointments or social engagements, and more.
<br/>
<br/>
Citi Bike is available for use 24 hours/day, 7 days/week, 365 days/year, and riders have access to thousands of bikes at hundreds of stations across Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens and Jersey City.

## Questions
Generally speaking, when we think about all of the data we have available to us from Citi Bike, we can come up with several questions that we would want a Tableau visualization to help answer. We need to think critically about which questions are the most important for our analysis.  

Citibike is successful in New York. Can it be as successful in Des Moines? What is the population of Des Moines? How does it's population compare to the population of New York City? Does the population affect the number of people who will use the bike-sharing program?

## Population
According to the New York Census(new_york_census.csv) data, the Population estimate base for July 1, 2018 was 8,398,748. While, the Des Moines Census(des_moines_census.csv) data shows the Population estimate base of 216,853  for July 1, 2018. That shows the population of New York is more than 38X that of Des Moines.  

## Growth
The census data sets, also, reveal that Des Moines population is growing year over year at a rapid pace of 6.2%. It's population increase rate is 230% greater than of New York's, which is at 2.7%. Now, that's growth and growth is opportunity.  

## Competition  
We will have competition. Des Moines BCycle is the area's only bike share program. Check out a bike from one kiosk and return it to any other kiosk. Whether you want to take a single trip or purchase an annual membership, there are all sorts of options for different frequency of riders.More info on their website,[desmoines.bcycle.com](https://desmoines.bcycle.com/).

## Weather
However, competition can be a good thing. Most of the hard analytic work has been done for us. Such as: 

### August 2019 in Des Moines  
**The average high was 84 degrees F**  
**The average low was 65 degrees F**  
**The record high was 109 degrees F**  
**The record low was 40 degrees F**  
**The average precipitation was 4.13 inches.**

Finding that the weather trends are close to each other. Anticipating that the similiar weather trends would reflect that of similiar outdoor activities taking place. However, by Bcycles presence and history of sales, we know that Des Moines is a good location for our service.

## About Bcycles
Bcycles is operating the same business model as our own. We would have to strategize to move in to claimed territory.
![](/pics/how.png)
## Strategy
A classic stradegy can be found at [fleximize.com](https://fleximize.com/articles/001027/7-steps-to-attracting-customers-away-from-your-competitors), **7 Steps to Attracting Customers Away From Your Competitors.** 
One of the most lucrative ways to improve your business is to attract your competitor’s customers to your business. Consumers will switch brands and businesses if they can see real value, so you need to give them a pretty good reason to choose your business over your competitors.  
  
Thorough competitor analysis is the strategic way of developing a clearer picture of what's happening in the market and giving you a basis to develop your own action plan. Follow these steps to make your business irresistible to your competitor’s customers:
1. Lower your prices

2. Create brand loyalty 

3. Raise your profile

4. Encourage brand advocates 

5. Find the gaps

6. Support your customers
  
7. Invest in m-commerce  

## Rates
Bcycles' rates are similiar to our until the pricing of the Annual Membership.  
Their Annual Membership is is $80+tax, which can be found at [desmoines.bcycle.com](https://desmoines.bcycle.com/top-nav-pages/rates-membership/rates2).  
<img align="left" width="350" src="/pics/b_rates.png"><br/> 
While, our Annual Membership is $169, which can be found at [citibikenyc.com](https://www.citibikenyc.com/pricing).

## Calculating Price
Lower your prices seems like the easiest solution when it comes to competition. However, the business needs to be profitable. So, calculating how much you can lower your price can be a bit tricky when considering cost to opporate. To get an idea of the cost to opporate, I went back to the census data sets. I found that the Median household income for Des Moines is $52,251 and $60,762 in New York, which is a 14% difference. I,also, found the Median selected monthly owner cost in Des Moines is $498 without a morgage and $1,204 a morgage. While, New York is $871 without a morgage and $2,665 with a morgage; that's 55% to %66 more. Showing that our cost to do business will be drastically less in Des Miones and we would have no problem lowering our price.  

## Leverage
We, also, have leverage. Lyft bought the company behind CitiBike. The company has bought Motivate, the firm behind NYC's CitiBike and Chicago's Divvy. With Lyft being the parent company and diversified, we can afford to go below cost and take a loss to gain the customers.
