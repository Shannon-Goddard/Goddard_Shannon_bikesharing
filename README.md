Now that we've gotten a good idea how to create our story, we can start to form a story to tell to our investors. 

Our goal is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. So we want to format our story so it's persuasive! We'll also want to include information about both New York City and Des Moinesâ€”after all, the investors will need to understand how the Citi Bike data for New York City applies to our proposal.

For this portion of the presentation, you'll work with a team that is trying to answer core questions about opening a bike-sharing business in Des Moines.
In this challenge, you will put together your final presentation and analysis for investors. You'll select the questions you want to answer, conduct independent research, craft your story in Tableau, and then create your written analysis.
#### Background
The moment has come to put together the final presentation for the investors. You've asked your data a lot of questions: the who, what, where, and how long. The Citi Bike data is ready to help you tell a story, but it's up to you and the team to deliver a compelling story. Your final deliverable might look different from a peer's deliverable, and that's okay.  

To craft this narrative for the investors, you'll do the following:
- Select your questions. During this step, you'll consider which results you want to share with your audience. What do they want to see? How can we use that information to make their decision making process easier?
- Execute independent research. You'll need to look at other relevant pieces of information to build a bigger picture. Search other sources to find information that will make your visualization more powerful.
- Craft your Tableau story. This is when you create your story, primarily from worksheets and other visuals, with descriptions for each of them.
- Create a written analysis. The written analysis is intended to provide additional insight into what we're trying to convey to our audience. This is a good place to add extra detail so that everyone can get on the same page.
## Objectives
The goals of this challenge are for you to:
- Display data professionally and accurately.
- Professionally style a Tableau story.
- Utilize previously created Tableau worksheets to create a new story.
- Create a Tableau story based on starting a bike-sharing company in Des Moines.  

#### Instructions
The tasks for this challenge are broken up into four key steps: select your questions, do independent research, craft your story, and write an analysis.
#### Step 1: Select Your Questions
When putting together an analysis, the first thing to consider is what question you will try to answer. To select your question, consider the analysis you have done on the NYC Citi Bike data and consider what investors might want to know about Des Moines in order to decide whether a bike-sharing program would work there. The questions your team has landed on are below. Choose one to focus on in your analysis.
- What is the population of Des Moines? How does its population compare to the population of New York City? Does the population affect the number of people who will use the bike-sharing program?
- What is the gender diversity of Des Moines? How does it compare to the gender diversity of New York City? What effect does it have on possible business in Des Moines?
- What is the density of McDonald's in New York City versus Des Moines? Does this affect where people go in the city? If so, how?
#### Step 2: Execute Independent Research
The next critical step is conducting independent research. In this case, consult various resources to help you get a better picture of what a bike-sharing business would look like in Des Moines.
The goal is to find key pieces of information that are relevant to the question you selected and that will help investors arrive at a decision more easily. Here are a few resources you might look at:
- [Des Moines Census Data](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/desmoinescityiowa)
- [Des Moines Tourism Website](https://www.catchdesmoines.com/things-to-do/)
- New York and Des Moines McDonald's dataset: 
  - Download ny_mcdonalds.csv
  - Download ia_mcdonalds.csv
#### Step 3: Craft Your Tableau Story
Create a Tableau story answering the question you selected. Use story points and arrows to describe your findings.

.
Then publish your Tableau story and dashboards to Tableau Public. Tableau Public is a way to share dashboards or stories that you have created online.
Note
Tableau Public should not be used for dashboards containing potentially private data; for this you should use Tableau Server. Private data is generally data that would have an impact on a business or person if it were released into the public. Since the data you're using is not considered private data, you can use Tableau Public.
You can publish your analysis to Tableau Public through the Tableau app. Follow these steps:
- Go to the Server dropdown menu and select Tableau Public.
- Click "Save to Tableau Public."
- To publish your analysis, log in to your Tableau account.
*For more information, see Tableau's documentation on saving workbooks to Tableau Public*
- Next, copy the link to use in your written analysis.
#### Step 4: Create a Written Analysis
The goal of your written analysis is to share additional thoughts with your audience, expanding on details and clarifying points that they may not understand. Stories in Tableau can be fairly open-ended, so a written analysis allows you to further share your insights and interpretation of the data in order to help your case.
**Length**
There is no official guideline for how long a written analysis should be, but you should write enough to convey your points.
**Content**
Your written analysis can include all or some of the following:
- A summary of your analysis
- A summary of each page in the Tableau story
- Clarifying any data that is unclear or complex
**Format**
Write your analysis in a markdown file named citibike_analysis.md, using VS Code. Your document should include a title. There are different sizes, or levels, of headings that correspond to the number of "#" signs preceding the title. For example:
# NYC Citi Bike Analysis
## Smaller Title
### Even Smaller Title
The following image shows what your file will look like with text added below the title:
# NYC Citi Bike Analysis 
This is a summary of the analytic work that I did with the NYC Citi Bike data.
## Smaller Title
### Even Smaller Title
When you put citibike_analysis.md in GitHub, here's what it will look like:
